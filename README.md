It also supports [ChatItem](https://github.com/dadus33-plugins/ChatItem) (tested on 2.3-2.4). Innuendos not included.

## Installing
You will need a spigot compatible server, like Bukkit, Paper or Pufferfish.  
Once your server is running, download the plugin from [Releases](https://github.com/ryhn-link/Minetrix/releases/) or build it yourself using `mvn package`, the output file will be `target/minetrix-(version number).jar`.  

## Configuration
Run the server with the plugin isntalled at least once, this will generate a default config file in `plugins/Minetrix/config.yml`.  
Message formats can be reloaded by running `/reloadminetrix` by a OP.  

### Matrix
Replace the `server` value in the `matrix` field with the address of your homeserver, e.g. `https://matrix.org`.  
Then replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the config with your access token.  
Finally replace the `room_id` value with your room ID or alias.  

### Message formatting
Messages can be customized by changing their format in the config.  
Minetrix2 supports separate formats for HTML and default message format.  
Fields in `format.html` will be used for HTML formatting, fields in `format.fallback` will be used for default formatting.  
Additionally you can change the `msgtype` of the message to add special effects or disable notifications for less important events.  

A placeholder is a substring consisting of a key and `%` it, it is replaced by a dynamic value, e.g. `%player% said %body%` will turn into `Ryhon said test`.
